        <h1>The Origin of London</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>The Romans(43CE to 5th century)</h2>
        <p>
            The area where London now is was first officially colonized in the Roman invasion of 43CE. The town of Londinium was then founded 4 years later in 47CE. Over the next 200 years, Londinium slowly grew in size, becoming the capital of Brittania at some point in hte 2nd century. At the end of the 2nd century and start of the 3rd, the Romans built a defensive wall around Londinium. This wall survived the next 1600 years and to this day, approximately defines the border of central London. From the beginning, London was a diverse city, boasting residents from every side of the mediterranean. In the 4th century, there began a decline in the Roman occupation of London, and, by 410CE, the Romans had left Londimium. The city was left abandoned for most of the 5th century.
        </p>
        <h2>The Anglo-Saxons</h2>
        <p>
            In the late 5th century, the Middle-Saxons (originating from Middlesex and the surrounding area) moved near to Londinium, initially staying clear of the now abandoned city and forming a trading town further west called Lundenwic. Over the next 200 years, Lundenwic and the area around it became a part of the East Saxon kingdom(from Essex). The next 200 years had Lundenwic passed between various Britannic kingdoms and, at one point, the vikings, before landing as part of the Mercian kingdom. At this time, the main city was moved into the now derelict Roman city, to utilize the pre-existing defenses. The city was rebuilt and named Lundenburh. The old settlement of Lundenwic was renamed ealdwic, a name that is still used as the modernized Aldwich. Another Roman settlement was also rebuilt across the river and named Southwark. In the start of the 11th century, the Normans invaded England and, while London was the last to fall in the country, by the mid 11th century, it was under Norman control.
