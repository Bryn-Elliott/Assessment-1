Colour Scheme
The choice of colours was a reflection of staples of London. Red was chosen to represent Red buses, red phone booths and the red coats of the Queen's guard
The accent colour was, again, related to the Queen's guard, namely their trousers.
The exact hue's chosen were mostly stylistic, slightly darkening the normally bright red of the London staples to be more pleasing to the eye
The charcoal grey used is an appetising accent colour for the burgundy red

The use of a top navbar was chosen for familiarity and ease-of-use of the user, giving a clear and consistent system of navigation about the website
The layout consisted of a top title and navbar that was consistent across all pages, tying together the website; an image relating to the single page and its' contents and the main content of the page, usually text with some accompanying figure
There were initially issues with implementing bootstrap and css loading correctly, these, however, have both been addressed and solved
